# BUILD-LOG

Append to this as you go. Commit it with the code it describes — the timestamps are part of the
evidence, and a log that arrives in one commit at the end reads as what it is.

Five lines is a real entry. Short and dated is better than long and reconstructed.

The categories we look for are listed in `DISCOVERY-BRIEF.md`. The example below shows the
*shape* of a good entry; it is a recreation of something already printed in `README.md`, so it
gives nothing away.

<!-- EXAMPLE — delete this block, keep the shape.

## 2026-03-04 · Phase 0 — orientation

Expected the unknown-permission test to fail on my validation code.
Observed: it passed, with foreign_keys ON, and *also* passed with the pragma removed — so the
check was never running, and the "pass" was the schema loading fine while enforcing nothing.
Changed: moved `foreign_keys = ON` to connection open and re-ran; now it raises
`FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` as the README said it would.
Note: this is the failure mode where a passing test is worse than a failing one.

## Phase 0 — orientation

2026-09-26: Created a clean repository from the candidate handout only. The previous workspace
was kept separate because its history contained reference-derived files; this repository starts
with commit `fb34d8b` and no reference implementation.

## Phase 1 — token verification

I expected malformed input to be rejected, but the test also exercises valid JSON values that are
not objects. I added structure checks before reading claims and constant-time signature comparison.
The verifier keeps the payload untrusted until the signature succeeds.

## Phase 2 — caller context and the resolution engine

I initially expected a device-specific allow to override a broader refusal because it is more
specific. The discriminating case in `scripts/check-permissions.js` kept the permission denied;
the reducer therefore records denials first and never lets an allow carve one out. The catalogue
is read from SQLite, so the personalized permission is handled without a code change.

## Phase 3 — orgs, members, invites

_Anything you had to work out that no document states. Invite lifecycle states are a common
source of this._

## Phase 4 — devices and grants

_What happens at the boundary where two grants disagree, or where a grant's scope and the
question's scope differ? Say what you predicted and what you got._

## Phase 5 — sessions

_Two permissions, one device. What did you have to resolve, and in what order, to keep the two
failure reasons distinguishable?_

## Phase 6 — audit

_What did you decide counts as an auditable event, and what pushed you to that line?_

## Phase 7 — the console

_Where did the server's answer and your instinct disagree about what should be on screen?_

## Phase 8 — hardening

_What did you measure, what did you fix, and what did you deliberately leave alone? Anything you
chose not to build belongs here with its reason._

## Open threads

_Things you know are wrong, unfinished, or that you would do differently with another day. Listing
these honestly is worth more than pretending they do not exist — we will find them anyway._
